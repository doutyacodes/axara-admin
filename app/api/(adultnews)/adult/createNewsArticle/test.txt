    "description": "There is a big storm called Cyclone Fengal that is coming to Chennai. The wind is blowing really hard, like when you blow out birthday candles but much stronger! The storm is making lots of rain, and it can make some places, like the streets in Chennai, very wet and messy, like splashing in puddles. The airport in Chennai is closed, which means no planes can come in or go out, a bit like when you can't go outside to play when it rains too much. The trains that usually take people to different places are also not running as often because of the strong winds and rain. It is important for everyone to stay safe at home, like a cozy blanket fort, and not go outside where it's windy and wet. People, especially fishermen, should not go out to the sea because the waves can be really big and scary!",

    "description": "A strong storm named Cyclone Fengal is moving towards Chennai, spinning in fast winds like a merry-go-round! It is expected to reach the coast this evening, with winds blowing at 70 to 80 kilometers per hour, which can gust even faster, like a big car racing down the street. Chennai and nearby areas, including Kancheepuram and Puducherry, are getting ready for heavy rain, so everyone is taking precautions. The Chennai airport is closed for the day, so no flights are taking off or landing, which is very unusual. Local trains are also not running on their normal schedule because of the bad weather. Lots of rain has already fallen in the last day, and more is expected soon, which can make the streets and low areas in the city flood with water like a bathtub overflowing. People are being advised to stay inside their homes, kind of like a time-out for safety, and not to go near the sea because the waves can become really dangerous. Thereâ€™s a chance that small trees might fall and things like power lines could be damaged due to the strong winds, so staying safe is the most 
important thing!",

    "description": "Chennai is currently facing the impending arrival of Cyclone Fengal, which is predicted to make landfall this evening 
between Karaikal and Mahabalipuram. With wind speeds reaching 70-80 kilometers per hour and gusts potentially hitting 90 kilometers per hour, the Indian Meteorological Department has advised residents of Chennai and surrounding districts, such as Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Kallakurichi, and Cuddalore, to prepare for severe weather conditions. Due to these weather conditions, the Chennai airport has been closed until the evening, which means flights have been canceled. Additionally, local train services, particularly those between Chennai Beach and Velachery, have been suspended since earlier today to ensure passenger safety. Heavy rainfall has already been recorded in various areas, especially along the northern coast of Tamil Nadu and parts of South Andhra Pradesh, and more heavy rain is forecast in the next 24 hours. The authorities warn of possible flooding in low-lying areas, including cities like Chennai and Mahabalipuram, urging people to remain indoors and avoid unnecessary risks. Fishermen are explicitly cautioned against venturing out to sea due to rough conditions. The strong winds associated with the cyclone could uproot small trees and damage homes, telephone, and power lines, emphasizing the need for community 
vigilance and preparedness.",
